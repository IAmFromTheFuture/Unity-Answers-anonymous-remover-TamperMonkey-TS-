# Unity-Answers-anonymous-remover-TamperMonkey-TS-
Unity has that annoying issue where the letters "hi" get replaced with "$$anonymous$$". This script simply changes the text content back.

Instructions:
1. Download the file
2. Install the TamperMonkey extension. (May also work with GreaseMonkey)
3. Go To "Utilities"
4. Next to "Import From File", you'll see "Browse", click and choose the file downloaded at (1)
5. Done.





Peace
